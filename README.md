With over 20 years of experience at the intersection of energy and data science, I have built a career defined by innovation, leadership, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. As a master geoscientist and seasoned project manager at Petrobras, I have spearheaded data-driven initiatives that not only delivered significant business value but also pushed the boundaries of industry standards. From contributing to the discovery of pre-salt reserves—South America's largest hydrocarbon accumulation—to founding VEX, a multi-regional enterprise operating across the USA, Europe, and South America, my journey has been marked by multidisciplinary expertise and a steadfast commitment to impactful leadership.

Key Highlights of My Professional Journey:
