With over 20 years of experience in energy and data science, I am a master geoscientist and project manager at Petrobras, where I lead data-driven innovations that deliver business value and drive industry advancements. From contributing to the discovery of pre-salt reserves, South America's largest hydrocarbon accumulation, to founding VEX and a Startup, company operating across the USA, Europe, and South America, my career has been shaped by multidisciplinary expertise and a commitment to impactful leadership.

My passion lies in transforming complex data into strategic business insights. By integrating traditional business methods with cutting-edge AI and machine learning, I deliver timely, actionable solutions that optimize performance in the energy sector and beyond. I hold a Master of Science in Reservoir Engineering, an Executive MBA. Moreover, I am currently completing a Masterâ€™s in Applied Data Science from University of Michigan and Data Engineering program from MIT.
